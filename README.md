# NEW FIRST REPO

This is the first repository that I have created on Github.
Today is October 13th 2021 and I am battling a slight head cold. 
October is my Birth Month and also seems to be the month to be sick in. 

## Outline of Expectations 

1. I want to get to where I can easily upload Emacs Org-mode files to GitHub
2. I need to identify the projects that I have already made to create repositories of them
3. I'm sure that there are Lisp Repositories
4.
